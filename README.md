# Testing Essentials

Testing Essentials are a portable unit-testing framework for R7RS-compliant Schemes.

## Running

For development I'm using R6RS Scheme run by (Dr)Racket. After the core features are done, backend will be switched to  [Chibi Scheme](//code.google.com/p/chibi-scheme) (the latest build from Mercurial trunk).

## Licensing

Testing Essentials are distributed under **[3-clause BSD license](LICENSE)**.
