# Testing Essentials

Testing Essentials are a portable unit-testing framework for R7RS-compliant Schemes.

## Running

For development I use [Chibi Scheme](//code.google.com/p/chibi-scheme) (the latest build from Mercurial trunk).

Testing Essentials are written with [Syntax Rules](//github.com/ilammy/sr) and are self-tested.

## Licensing

Testing Essentials are distributed under **[3-clause BSD license](LICENSE)**.
